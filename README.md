# Coupon Service UI

This is the frontend service consuming the backend **coupon service**. You'll need latest version of node to run it.

- First we need to install dependencies using:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

- Then, you can run the application by starting the server using
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Ensure you have set the `VITE_HOST` environment variable pointed correctly to the coupon service.
